This AWS CloudFormation template sets up a Linux EC2 instance with Apache installed, using existing network resources such as a VPC, Public Subnet, and Security Group. Below is an analysis and summary of the key components of the template:

Key Components

Parameters
•	VPC: Accepts an existing VPC ID.
•	PublicSubnet: Accepts an existing public subnet ID.
•	InstanceType: Allows selection of EC2 instance types with a default of t2.micro.
•	AMIId: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID with a default value.
•	KeyName: Specifies the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair.
•	InstanceNameTag: Provides a name tag for the EC2 instance.
•	EnvironmentTag: Provides an environment tag for the EC2 instance.

Mappings
•	RegionMap: Maps regions to their corresponding AMI IDs.

Resources
•	myEIP: Allocates an Elastic IP (EIP) address.
•	EC2Instance: Creates an EC2 instance with the specified parameters and user data to install Apache and create a sample webpage.
•	EIPAssociation: Associates the Elastic IP with the EC2 instance.
•	WebServerSecurityGroup: Creates a security group allowing HTTP traffic on port 80.

Outputs
•	InstanceId: Exports the EC2 instance ID.
•	InstancePublicIp: Exports the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
•	VPCId: Exports the VPC ID.
•	PublicSubnetId: Exports the subnet ID.
•	WebServerSecurityGroupId: Exports the security group ID.
•	PrivateIPAddress: Exports the private IP address of the EC2 instance.
•	PublicDNSName: Exports the public DNS name of the EC2 instance.

Notes on Changes
1.	UserData: The UserData section includes a script that:
o	Updates the system.
o	Installs Apache.
o	Creates a sample HTML file.
o	Starts and enables the Apache service.
2.	Tags: The EC2 instance is tagged with Name and Environment.
3.	Outputs: Includes outputs for PrivateIPAddress and PublicDNSName, which are necessary for the assignment.

Additional Information
•	Ensure that the provided AMI ID corresponds to a Linux image compatible with the instance type.
•	The security group allows all inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP), which is suitable for a public web server but should be carefully considered in a production environment.
This template provides a robust starting point for deploying a web server in AWS using CloudFormation, leveraging existing network infrastructure.
